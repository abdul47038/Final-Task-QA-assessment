# cypress-html-reporter

A simple Cypress HTML reporter. Generates an HTML report at the end of the test execution.
(Works only for Cypress ver. 13.4 and above)

## Installation

```bash
npm install cypress-html-reporter --save
```

## Usage
Add the following to the cypress.config.ts/js file:

```python
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  retries: {
    runMode: 1
  },
  e2e: {
    video: true,
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // implement node event listeners here
      require('cypress-html-reporter/GenerateReport')(on, config)
    },
  },
});

```
Once the test execution is done, start the report server.
(Create a .js file at the project root directory and run following command.) 

```bash
const startServer = require('cypress-html-reporter/StartServer')
startServer()
```
This will host the report server (embedded screenshots/video links are blocked by the browser hence this is necessary). Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in the browser.
